== What is MicroProfile

link:https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] is an open-source specification that enhances enterprise Java technologies for microservices development. It provides a set of APIs and specifications for building modern, scalable, resilient, and efficient microservices-based applications. The primary goal of MicroProfile is to simplify the development for Java developers, enabling them to create applications optimized for cloud-native-development.

MicroProfile was initiated in June 2016 by a collaboration of industry leaders, Java community members, and individual contributors. In the following year, the project was transitioned to the link:https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse Foundation] to enhance the project's openness and vendor-neutral stance. Now, MicroProfile has become a key framework for extending Java in the cloud-computing domain, offering a comprehensive suite of APIs tailored for developing microservices in a cloud-native ecosystem.

== Need for MicroProfile

The MicroProfile Specification was developed to address the following requirements:

- *Microservices Architecture Adoption*: The industry shift towards microservices architecture has brought several advantages, including improved flexibility, scalability, and speed of deployment. However, it also introduced several new challenges for developers due to the added complexities. These include ensuring seamless integration between microservices, securing each microservice individually as well as interactions between them, managing performance and efficiency, designing microservices to be fault-tolerant and resilient to failures, ensuring data consistency across services, managing configurations across multiple environments and managing various independently deployable components. To address these challenges, MicroProfile provides a simplified and optimized set of APIs designed to build and deploy Java-based microservices applications.

- *Limitations of Traditional Enterprise Java*: Traditional enterprise Java frameworks, like Java EE (now Jakarta EE), were often seen as too monolithic and heavyweight for microservices while evolving too slowly. It led to a demand for a more streamlined and microservices-focused framework. MicroProfile fills this gap by providing a lightweight alternative optimized for microservices development.

- *Cloud-Native Application Development*: The rise of cloud-native applications necessitated new features such as external configuration, health checks, and fault tolerance, which existing Java standards did not adequately address. MicroProfile bridges these gaps left, making it easier for developers to create resilient, scalable, and manageable microservices for cloud-native application development using Java.

- *Community-Driven Innovation*: The rapid pace of technological change in microservices necessitated a collaborative platform for innovation. MicroProfile, backed by community and vendor support, promotes rapid evolution to meet these demands.

- *Vendor Neutrality and Interoperability*: There was a need for a framework that could provide standardization across different implementations and environments, ensuring compatibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

- *Focus on Simplicity and Productivity*: Developers needed a simple, easy-to-understand framework that increased productivity by reducing boilerplate code and focusing on essential microservice functionalities. Well-defined standards and patterns eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel, allowing developers to focus on microservices logic.

- *Support for familiar programming model*: MicroProfile was founded with support for Jakarta JSON Processing, Jakarta JSON Binding, Jakarta RESTful Web Services, and Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) to define the core programming model and accelerate adoption.

- *Lightweight and Resilient Services*: With the microservices architecture, there's a need for frameworks that support the development of lightweight, resilient, and independently deployable services, which are essential for microservices.

- *Rapid Adaptation to New Trends*: The technology landscape, especially around microservices, is constantly evolving. A framework like MicroProfile, which is community-driven and rapidly evolving, can adapt quickly to these changes, continually incorporating new practices and technologies, including: 
  ** *Streaming APIs and Reactive Programming Model*: To facilitate non-blocking communication and data processing, enhancing system responsiveness and scalability.
  ** *API-First Development (Open API)*: Emphasizing the design and documentation of microservices with an API-first approach, promoting interoperability and clear service contracts.
  ** *Eventual Consistency and Long Running Actions (LRA)*: Addressing the challenges of data consistency in distributed systems without compromising system performance.

- *Enhanced Observability and Monitoring*: Microservices architectures complicate application monitoring and observability. A framework with built-in support for these capabilities simplifies the management of distributed services.

== Relationship with Jakarta EE specification

Jakarta EE is an open specification with more than 40 component specifications to address a wide array of needs of enterprise Java development. MicroProfile complements this by providing a baseline platform definition that optimizes enterprise Java for microservices architecture and delivers application portability across multiple compatible runtimes. Many Jakarta EE implementations that target a broad array of applications supplement Jakarta EE with MicroProfile to better support microservices. Their coexistence allows developers to harness the strength of both platforms, thereby facilitating a more versatile and adaptive approach to modern enterprise and cloud-native application development. MicroProfile strategically leverages Java EE developers' existing skill sets, enabling them to transition and adapt to microservices development with minimal learning curve. This ensures that developers can easily design and implement microservices architecture, enhancing productivity and facilitating the creation of cloud-native applications. Later in this tutorial, we will explore how MicroProfile API extends Jakarta EE’s capability to address microservices-specific challenges.

NOTE: MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are complementary technologies. Both platforms enable developers to stay at the forefront of cloud-native application development.
