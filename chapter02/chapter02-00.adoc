= Chapter 2: Getting Started with MicroProfile

== Introduction 

In this chapter, you'll embark on your MicroProfile journey! We will guide you through creating your first microservice, equipping you with the essential understanding to leverage this robust framework for building modern, cloud-native applications. This journey begins with setting up your development environment, then diving into creating a microservice.

== Topics Covered

- Development Environment Setup
- Configuring Build Tools
- Initializing a New MicroProfile Project
- Choosing Right Modules for your Application
- Building a RESTful service
- Deployment
- Testing your microservices
- Exploring Further with MicroProfile

== Development Environment Setup

Let's begin by preparing your workspace for MicroProfile development:

=== Java Development Kit (JDK)

MicroProfile, a Java framework, runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making the Java Development Kit (JDK) an essential component of your development environment. 

To install JDK, follow the steps below:

. *Download*: Visit the official link:https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK] website and download the JDK version compatible with your operating system.

. *Install*: Follow the installation instructions provided on this official link:https://openjdk.org/install/[OpenJDK Installation] guide.

. *Verify*: After Installation, run the following command in your command line or terminal to verify the Installation: 

[source, bash]
----
java -version.
----

You should an output similar to the one below: 
----
openjdk 17.0.10 2024-01-16 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Microsoft-8902769 (build 17.0.10+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Microsoft-8902769 (build 17.0.10+7-LTS, mixed mode, 
sharing)
----

This confirms that JDK 17 has been successfully installed on your system.

NOTE: For most MicroProfile implementations, JDK 11 or later is recommended. In 
this tutorial, we will be using JDK 17. While OpenJDK is used here, other JDK 
providers such as Oracle JDK, Amazon Corretto, and Azul Zulu also offer 
compatible JDK distributions.

=== Build Tools (Maven or Gradle)

Build tools like link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] or link:https://gradle.org/[Gradle] are commonly used for managing project dependencies and building Java applications. You can install the one that best fits your project needs. Here's a brief overview to help you decide:

* *Apache Maven*: Known for its convention-over-configuration approach, Maven is a popular choice due to its simple project setup and extensive plugin repository. 

* *Gradle*: Offers a flexible, script-based build configuration, allowing for highly customized build processes. Gradle is renowned for its superior performance, due to its incremental builds  and caching mechanisms. It's a great choice for complex projects requiring customization.

IMPORTANT: If your existing project's build uses Maven wrapper (`mvnw`) or Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`), you don't to install any of these build tools. These wrappers help ensure a consistent build environment without requiring the build tools to be installed on your system. 

==== Installing Apache Maven

To install Maven follow the steps below: 

. Visit the link:https://https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Installing Apache Maven] web page to download the latest version. 

. Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

. Verify the Maven installation by running this command in your terminal or command line.

----
mvn -v
----

You should see output similar to:

----
Apache Maven 3.9.6 (bc0240f3c744dd6b6ec2920b3cd08dcc295161ae)
Maven home: /usr/local/sdkman/candidates/maven/current
Java version: 17.0.10, vendor: Microsoft, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/msopenjdk-current
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "6.2.0-1019-azure", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
----

After Maven is installed, you can configure the _pom.xml_ file in your project to include the MicroProfile dependencies.

==== Gradle

To install Gradle follow the step below: 

. Visit the link:https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle | Installation] web page to download the latest version.
. Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.
. Verify the installation by running this command in your terminal or command line.

----
gradle -version 
----

You should see output similar to:

----
Welcome to Gradle 8.6!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Configurable encryption key for configuration cache
 - Build init improvements
 - Build authoring improvements

After Gradle is installed, you can configure the _build.gradle_ file in your project to include the MicroProfile dependencies.

Whether you opt for Maven's stability and convention or Gradle's flexibility and performance, understanding how to configure and use your chosen build tool is important for MicroProfile development.

=== Integrated Development Environments

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enhance developer productivity by providing a rich set of features and extensions such as project boostraping, dependency management, intelligent code completion, configuration assistance, test runners, build, hot deployment and debugging tools. For MicroProfile development, the choice of IDE can significantly affect your development speed and efficiency. Below is a list of popular IDEs and their key features related to Java and MicroProfile development:

=== MicroProfile Starter
To kickstart your MicroProfile project, use the MicroProfile Starter to generate a sample project with your chosen server and specifications. This tool provides a customizable project structure and generates necessary boilerplate code and configuration.

* Visit the link:https://start.microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] Starter page - the official website for generating the MicroProfile project templates.

* Provide a `groupId` for your project, it's an identifier for your project and should be unique to avoid conflicts with other libraries or projects.

TIP: Its recommended convention is to start your `groupId` with the reverse domain name of your organization (for example, `io.microprofile`).

* Enter the 'artifactID', which is the name of your project (e.g., 'mp-ecomm-store').

* Select the *Java SE version* your project will use.

* Select the *MicroProfile version* you want to use. Ideally, you should choose the latest version for the most up-to-date features but also consider the runtime’s support.

* Select the specifications you want to include in your project. These could be Config, Fault Tolerance, JWT Auth, Metrics, Health, Open API, Open Tracing, Rest Client. Choose what is relevant to your application.

* Click the _Download_ button.

* Unzip the generated project and import it into your IDE.

Important: At the time of writing this tutorial, the latest MicroProfile released version was 6.1. The MicroProfile Starter does not currently support this version. Hence, we will not be using MicroProfile Starter to generate the project structure.

This completes the development environment setup. Now we are all set to begin development using MicroProfile.

IMPORTANT: At the time of writing this tutorial, the latest MicroProfile released version was 6.1. We will not be using MicroProfile Starter to generate the project structure as it does not support this version through any of the implementation.
