== Developing a RESTful Web Service

*Web Services* are very popular nowadays because they allow for building decoupled systems 
– services can communicate with each other without the knowledge of each other’s implementation details.
There are many different ways to design and implement web services. One popular way is to use the Representational State Transfer (REST)
architecture. A Jakarta RESTful Webservice is a web service that uses the *Representational State Transfer (REST)* architecture. 
This type of web service makes it easy to build modern, scalable web applications. The REST architecture is based on the principle that
all data and functionality should be accessed through a uniform interface. This makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy web 
applications.
  
To understand this better, let’s create a simple RESTful service to manage a list of products for our sample application, 
the MicroProfile ecommerce store. This RESTful API will allow client applications to access the product information stored as 
resources on the server. For example, let’s say you have a product catalog that you want to make available as a web service. 
With REST, you would create a URL that represents the resources (products) in your catalog. When a client (such as a web browser) 
requests this URL, the server would return a list of products in JSON format.

=== Creating an Entity class
An Entity class represents a specific object, in our case a product. It contains the product's details id and name, 
and other properties like price, quantity etc. To implement an entity class first, you need to create a Product class, as below:

[source, java]
----
// Product.java
package io.microprofile.tutorial.store.product.entity;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Product {
   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private String description;
   private Double price;
}
----
  
The `Product` class is a Plain Old Java Object (POJO). It has an `id`, `name`, `description` and `price` property. 
The `id` property is of type `Long`, The `name` and `description` properties are of type `String`. The `price` property is of 
type `Double`. `@Data` annotation will generate constructors, getters, and setters for all fields. By doing this, 
you enable the Jackson library to convert your Java objects to JSON and vice versa. All properties must be of `Object` type as well.
Jackson cannot work with primitive types because they cannot be `null`.
`@AllArgsConstructor` generates a constructor with one argument for each field in the class. 
This is useful for instantiating objects with all their fields initialized. `@NoArgsConstructor` generates a default constructor 
for the class.

=== Creating a Resource class

A resource class represents a collection of related resources. It includes methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving 
(CRUD) operations on the resources. Let us now create a `ProductResource` class with a `getProducts()` method to return a list of 
`Product` objects.

[source, java]
----
// ProductResource.java
package io.microprofile.tutorial.store.product.resource;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import io.microprofile.tutorial.store.product.entity.Product;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/products")
@ApplicationScoped
public class ProductResource {
   private List<Product> products;

   public ProductResource() {
       products = new ArrayList<>();

       products.add(new Product(Long.valueOf(1L), "iPhone", "Apple iPhone 15", Double.valueOf(999.99)));
       products.add(new Product(Long.valueOf(2L), "MacBook", "Apple MacBook Air", Double.valueOf(1299.99)));
   }

   @GET
   @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
   public List<Product> getProducts() {
       // Return a list of products
       return products;
   }   
}
----
  
The `ProductResource` is annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`. This will ensure that this class is available as long as the 
application is running. The `ProductResource` class has a `getProducts()` method, which returns a list of products. This method is annotated with the @GET annotation, which maps this method to the GET HTTP method. The @Produces annotation tells the server that this method produces JSON content. This will return the following JSON response when we make a GET request to the /api/products endpoint.
RESTful web services can produce and consume many different media types, including JSON, XML, and HTML. 
Annotations specify the media type that a method can consume or produce. For example, if a method is annotated with 
`@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)` it can produce JSON.

=== Creating a Resource class

Create a class named `ProductRestApplication` as per the code below:

[source, java]
----
// ProductRestApplication.java
package io.microprofile.tutorial.store.product;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class ProductRestApplication extends Application{

}
---- 
  
The annotation @ApplicationPath("/api") specifies that any RESTful resources registered within this application will be accessed 
under the base path `/api`. For example, if you have a resource class named `ProductResource` mapped to the path `/products`, 
it would be accessible at `/api/products`.

=== Building Your Application

You may build the application using the following commands from your project’s root directory:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn compile
----

The above command will compile your project’s source code.

  
[source, bash]
----
$ mvn test
----

The above command will run the test using a unit testing framework. These test should not require the code to be packaged and deployed.

  
[source, bash]
----
$mvn package
----
  
The above command will create a deployment package.

=== Deploying your microservices

This section guides you through deploying your newly created product microservice to a runtime environment. Below are some of the general considerations:

==== General Considerations:
* Runtime Compatibility: Ensure your chosen runtime supports the MicroProfile version used in your project.
* Packaging: Decide on a packaging format (e.g., WAR file, Docker image).
* Configuration: Review and adjust any runtime configuration necessary for your service.
* Deployment Tools: Leverage runtime-specific tools or commands for deployment.

==== Deployment Options
You can then deploy this application on a MicroProfile compatible server and access the web service at 
`http://localhost:<port>/<contextRoot>/api/products`. Replace `<port>` with the port number on which the web server or 
application server is listening. The `<contextRoot>` is a placeholder for the context root of the web application. 
The context root is part of the URL path that identifies the base path for the application on the web server. 

Below are the steps for popular options. Specific steps will depend on your chosen runtime.

*Open Liberty* 

Package your application as a WAR file using Maven or Gradle by adding the packaging tag in `pom.xml`.

[source, xml]
----
<groupId>io.microprofile.tutorial</groupId>
<artifactId>mp-ecomm-store</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>war</packaging>
----
  
Add a server configuration file at the location /main/liberty/config/server.xml with the content as below:

[source, xml]
----
<server description="MicroProfile Tutorial Liberty Server">
    <featureManager>
        <feature>restfulWS-3.1</feature>
        <feature>jsonb-3.0</feature>
    </featureManager>

    <httpEndpoint httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}"
                  id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />
    <webApplication location="mp-ecomm-store.war" contextRoot="${app.context.root}"/>
</server>
----
  
Add the Open Liberty configuration in the pom.xml as below:

[source, xml]
----
<properties>
   <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
   <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
   <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
   <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
   <!-- Liberty configuration -->
   <liberty.var.default.http.port>9080</liberty.var.default.http.port>
   <liberty.var.default.https.port>9443</liberty.var.default.https.port>
   <liberty.var.app.context.root>mp-ecomm-store</liberty.var.app.context.root>
 </properties>

Add the Open Liberty build plugin in the pom.xml as below:
<build>
    <finalName>${project.artifactId}</finalName>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.3.2</version>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <serverName>productServer</serverName>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <systemPropertyVariables>
                    <http.port>${liberty.var.default.http.port}</http.port>
                    <war.name>${liberty.var.app.context.root}</war.name>
                </systemPropertyVariables>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>

=== Running Your Application

Refer to your runtime’s documentation for instructions on running your MicroProfile application. 
For example, Consult the Open Liberty documentation for detailed instructions: 
link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile.html[MicroProfile - Open Liberty Docs]
Finally, use the following command from the command line or terminal to run the application on Liberty server. 

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn liberty:run
----
  
You can also run the following command to start the liberty server in development mode.

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn liberty:dev
---- 
  
Assuming your server is running on `http://localhost:9080/`, you can access your service at:
`http://localhost:9080/mp-ecomm-store/api/products`.

To call this RESTful web service, you can enter the URL in your browser. The response is an array of JSON objects. 
Each object has an id, name, description and price property. Please note only GET methods can be tested with browsers.
The response should be

[source, json]
----
[{"description":"Apple iPhone 15","id":1,"name":"iPhone","price":999.99},{"description":"Apple MacBook Air","id":2,"name":"MacBook","price":1299.99}]
----
  
This uses an in-memory list; In the next chapter, in a real application you should integrate a database (via Jakarta Persistence API). We will be learning about this in the next chapter.
